# eWay-CRM API

## First Steps

Visit the [eWay-CRM website](https://www.eway-crm.com) and sign up for a free trial.

Fork our [Postman collection](https://eway.cr/postman).

Ask our [support](mailto:support@eway-crm.com) to generate ClientID / ClientSecret for you.
Or use our test service:
* **WS URL**: https://free.eway-crm.com/31994
* **UserName**: api
* **Password**: ApiTrial@eWay-CRM

> [!NOTE]
> See [How to find Web Service URL](https://www.eway-crm.com/resources/how-to-use-eway-crm/set-or-change-web-service-address/).
> For production use we recommend to see [How to create a new user just for API integration](https://kb.eway-crm.com/en/faq-1/installation/how-to-create-api-user).
> Also make sure the user has [enough permissions](https://kb.eway-crm.com/en/documentation/5-administration-application/1-users/users-create-and-manage#effective-permissions) for the required operations.

Fill in your details in the Postman *Variables* tab:

Go to *Login* method and inside Auth tab click *Get New Access Token*. While you login
use the same user name as you previously specified in Postman *Variables*.

As soon as you have *Access Token* click *Send* to create new session.

With a session being generated you can start calling other methods eg. *SaveJournal* to create a new Journal in eWay-CRM.
